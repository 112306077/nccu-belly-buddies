1. `SUPER_EMAIL`: Your super admin email.
2. `DATABASE_URL`: We are using MongoDB, please replace your Username, Password,
   and name your Database Name.
3. (optional) In `/app/constants/env.ts` set `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`: This key is
   used to
   [get Turnstile token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/)
   in client, if you use
   [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) as
   captcha, so should be exposed in the frontend with _VITE_\_ prefix.
4. (optional) `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`: Used to
   [verify Turnstile token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/)
   get in the frontend in the backend
5. `AED_SECRET`: Used to encrypt your magic link for authentication flow. Run
   `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` to
   get one.
6. `COOKIE_SECRET`: Used to make your cookies secure. Run
   `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"` to
   get one
7. `RESEND_API_KEY`: Send emails via Resend.
8. `BASE_URL`: This is the domain where you're hosting your PapaCMS. e.g.
   `BASE_URL=papacms.com`

### 2. Install and generate prisma schema, then start

Run this in `/` shell to install packages and
[generate prisma schema for database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/mongodb#how-to-use-prisma-orm-with-mongodb).

```sh
npm i && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push
```

### 3. Start in dev mode

> For first time ever, you should set super admin email address in `.env` file,
> and make sure your email server has set (fill in your `RESEND_API_KEY`). Then
> run `npm run check-admin && npm run dev`, it will send a verification email to
> you. After verify, papa will create an ADMIN role user and you will see
> `role : "ADMIN"` in the database **User** table.

Run this in `/` shell to start in dev mode, press `q` to exit application, `r`
to restart.

```sh
npm run check-admin && npm run dev
```

If you sure have already created admin:

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. Sign in at route `/admin`
